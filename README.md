# 👋 Welcome to my Portfolio
I am an aspiring **Security Enthusiast** and **IoT Tinkerer** currently sharpening my skills in ethical hacking and secure development.  

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring  
- **Offensive Security Basics**: Learning penetration testing tools (Burp Suite, Nmap) and methodologies.  
- **IoT Security**: Experimenting with firmware analysis, hardware hacking, and securing smart devices.  
- **Secure Coding**: Building small IoT projects while prioritizing security best practices.  

## 🔧 Current Toolkit
- Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit (for ethical hacking practice)  
- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RFID tools (for IoT projects)  
- Python, C/C++, and a lot of curiosity  

### 🚀 Let’s Connect 
Open to guidance, feedback, or casual chats about cybersecurity and IoT! Star ⭐ a repo if it sparks your interest, or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joshsoguilon).
