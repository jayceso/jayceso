👋 Hi! I’m **Josh**, an aspiring **Security Enthusiast** and **IoT Tinkerer** currently sharpening my skills in ethical hacking and secure development.  

🌱 **What I’m Exploring**  
- **Offensive Security Basics**: Learning penetration testing tools (Burp Suite, Nmap) and methodologies.  
- **IoT Security**: Experimenting with firmware analysis, hardware hacking, and securing smart devices.  
- **Secure Coding**: Building small IoT projects while prioritizing security best practices.  

💡 **Why I’m Here**  
I’m passionate about understanding how systems work—and how they break. My repos reflect my hands-on experiments, from simple vulnerability labs to IoT device prototypes. I’m all about learning in public and growing through collaboration!  

🔧 **Current Toolkit**  
- Kali Linux, Wireshark, Metasploit (for ethical hacking practice)  
- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RFID tools (for IoT projects)  
- Python, C/C++, and a lot of curiosity  

🚀 **Let’s Connect**  
Open to guidance, feedback, or casual chats about cybersecurity and IoT! Star ⭐ a repo if it sparks your interest, or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joshsoguilon).
